# Chores Calculations Shiny app integrated with Google Sheets and Google forms

# Introduction
Recently my wife and I decided to implement a chore system to our kids. Basically we give them point for each chore they make and at the end a period (e.g. week) each one gets a certain amount of money. The amount is based on the points they make and requires keeping track of their activities over the period. At this point my data scientists side saids: you should write an app for that. Since I have not given a try to R in a while, I decided to make the appw with Shiny apps. 

# The plan
The points for each kid will be recorded on a google form and the app will access both the form, to submit new tasks, and the associated spreadsheet, to analyze the data and generate a table of unpaid chores. 

# The result 
A nice app that can be used to keep track the acitivy of the kids at home.
AND you knoe tha saying, happy wife, happy life.
